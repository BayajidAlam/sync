- 1 vpc
- 2 public subnet
    - 1st subnet(public sn-1): for server to ssh into private subnet's ec2 instances, and client app
    - 2nd subnet: for alb
- 3 private subnet
    - 1st(private-sn-1): Node app 
    - 2nd private-sn-2: Node app 
    - 3rd(private-sn-3): MongoDB 
- 1 igw
- 1 public route table
- 1 private route table
- 4 ec2 instance
    - 1 for bastion server and client app (public sn-1)

- 4 security group
- 1 nat gateway
- 1 alb
- 1 target group
- 1 listener
- 1 key pair
- 1 asg
 

flow: 
- ssh form local host into bastion server
- from bastion ssh into private-sn-1,2 (app servers) and private-sn-3 (DB server)
- app servers only receive traffic from alb
- db only entertain app server cidr
- for scalability - asg for auto scaling that is attached to the alb
- and all other networking association
