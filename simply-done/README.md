## Problem Statement

We have to create a Notes & To-Do application named SimplyDone, containerize both the frontend and backend, and publish the containers to Docker Hub. These containers will be deployed across multiple AWS EC2 instances to ensure fault tolerance. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will be implemented to distribute traffic and provide high availability across instances.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust, cloud-native Notes & To-Do application by leveraging modern containerization and cloud deployment technologies. The application, consisting of a React frontend and Node.js backend, will be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency, portability, and simplified deployments across environments. These Docker images will be published to Docker Hub for centralized access and reuse.

The backend containers will be deployed across multiple AWS EC2 instances managed by an autoscaling group to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Autoscaling will dynamically adjust the number of backend instances (2-5) to match traffic demands, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will be implemented to distribute incoming traffic evenly across backend instances, ensuring smooth operation and reliable user experiences.

The frontend will be containerized and deployed to EC2, remaining independent of the autoscaling and load balancing configuration used for the backend. This architecture delivers a scalable, resilient, and efficient solution for modern cloud-based application deployment.

## Architecture Overview

The SimplyDone Notes & To-Do Application consists of three main components:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simply-done.git
cd simply-done
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
yarn install

# Backend  
cd ../server
yarn install
cd ..
```

**3. Set Up Environment Variables**

#### For Local Development:

Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:

```bash
# MongoDB Atlas credentials for development
DB_USER=your_atlas_username
DB_PASS=your_atlas_password
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=12h
NODE_ENV=development
```

Create a `.env` file in the `/client` directory:

```bash
# Backend URL (will be auto-configured for production)
VITE_APP_BACKEND_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**Note**: Production environment variables are automatically configured by the deployment pipeline.

## Deployment Commands

The application provides automated deployment commands via Makefile:

**Complete Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
make auto-deploy
```
This runs the complete deployment pipeline: infrastructure â†’ backend â†’ frontend.

**Individual Components**
```bash
# Deploy AWS infrastructure
make setup-infrastructure

# Deploy backend services  
make setup-backend

# Deploy frontend
make deploy-frontend-with-alb

# Build and deploy containers
make build-deploy
```

**Development & Testing**
```bash
# Build Docker images
make build-all

# Push to Docker Hub
make push-all

# Test deployment health
make test-deployment

# Debug system status
make debug-system

# Emergency redeploy
make emergency-redeploy
```

**Cleanup**
```bash
# Clean local resources
make clean-all

# Destroy all AWS resources
cd pulumi_IaC
pulumi destroy --yes
```

## Application URLs

After successful deployment, your application will be accessible at:

- **Frontend**: `http://<FRONTEND_PUBLIC_IP>` (auto-displayed after deployment)
- **Backend API**: `http://<ALB_DNS_NAME>` (auto-configured)
- **Health Check**: `http://<ALB_DNS_NAME>/health`

Example URLs:
- Frontend: `http://54.179.59.231`
- Backend: `http://alb-41653d7-2112601569.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com`

## Auto Scaling Across Multiple AZs

Our autoscaling setup distributes backend instances across multiple availability zones for maximum fault tolerance and performance.

### Multi-AZ Configuration

**Availability Zones:**
- **AZ-A (ap-southeast-1a)**: Private subnet for backend instances (10.10.3.0/24)
- **AZ-B (ap-southeast-1b)**: Private subnet for backend instances (10.10.4.0/24)  
- **AZ-C (ap-southeast-1c)**: Private subnet for MongoDB (10.10.5.0/24)

**Auto Scaling Group Configuration:**
```bash
Desired Capacity: 2 instances
Minimum Size: 1 instance
Maximum Size: 5 instances
Health Check: ELB with 300 seconds grace period
```

### Instance Distribution

**Initial Deployment (2 instances):**
```
AZ-A: 1 backend instance
AZ-B: 1 backend instance
```

**Scale-Up Scenarios:**
```
3 instances: AZ-A (2), AZ-B (1) or AZ-A (1), AZ-B (2)
4 instances: AZ-A (2), AZ-B (2) 
5 instances: AZ-A (3), AZ-B (2) or AZ-A (2), AZ-B (3)
```

### Scaling Triggers

**Scale-Up Policy:**
- Triggers when CPU utilization > 80% for 4 minutes
- Adds 1 instance with 5-minute cooldown
- New instance deploys to AZ with fewer instances

**Scale-Down Policy:**
- Triggers when CPU utilization < 10% for 4 minutes  
- Removes 1 instance with 5-minute cooldown
- Maintains minimum 1 instance for availability

### Fault Tolerance Benefits

**Single AZ Failure Scenario:**
1. ALB automatically stops routing traffic to failed AZ
2. Remaining instances in healthy AZ handle all traffic
3. Autoscaling detects unhealthy instances and replaces them
4. When failed AZ recovers, instances redistribute automatically

**Load Balancer Integration:**
- ALB spans public subnets in AZ-A and AZ-B
- Routes traffic only to healthy backend instances
- Performs health checks every 30 seconds
- Automatically registers new instances from autoscaling

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **502 Bad Gateway**: Backend containers not healthy
   ```bash
   make debug-system
   make setup-backend
   ```

2. **CORS Errors**: Frontend can't communicate with backend
   ```bash
   make quick-redeploy
   ```

3. **Cannot GET /register or /login**: Nginx routing issue
   - Check nginx configuration excludes React routes from API proxy

4. **Database Connection Issues**: 
   ```bash
   # Check MongoDB status
   ssh -i pulumi_IaC/MyKeyPair.pem ubuntu@<mongodb-ip>
   sudo docker logs mongodb
   ```

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# System overview
make debug-system

# Network connectivity  
make debug-network

# Deployment health
make test-deployment

# Container logs
sudo docker logs -f simply-done-server
sudo docker logs -f simply-done-client
```

## Scaling for High Load

### Current Multi-AZ Features
- **3-AZ Distribution** across ap-southeast-1a, 1b, and 1c
- **Cross-AZ Auto Scaling** with 2-5 backend instances
- **Zone-Level Fault Tolerance** with automatic traffic routing
- **Isolated Database Zone** for performance optimization

### Upgrade Path for High Traffic
1. **Database**: Migrate to AWS DocumentDB + Redis caching
2. **Scaling**: Increase to 10+ instances with request-based metrics  
3. **Performance**: Enable gzip compression and API rate limiting
4. **Containers**: Move to ECS/Fargate for better management
5. **Frontend**: Use S3 + CloudFront for static assets

Your current architecture provides a solid foundation for incremental scaling.
